<p>Welcome to Official Glacial&trade; Bot Discord Server.<br />In this server , you <strong>must</strong> agree to the Rule of&nbsp;Glacial&trade;&nbsp; Bot Discord Server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Glacial&trade;&nbsp; Bot Discord Server, we expect that each member of our community treat others and staff members with utmost respect. Though you may have different opinions on a subject, we ask that you remain civil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_2:_Spamming." class="mw-headline">Rule 1: Spamming.</span></h4>
<p>We define "spamming" as sending multiple messages in a short period of time.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_3:_Advertising." class="mw-headline">Rule 2: Advertising.</span></h4>
<p>We define "advertising" as sending links to other servers, or sending links to YouTube or other media channels. This rule applies to Direct Messages as well.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_4:_Filter_Bypassing." class="mw-headline">Rule 3: Filter Bypassing.</span></h4>
<p>We use <a title="Glacial Bot Offical Website" href="https://www.glacialbot.com/"><strong>Glacial Bot</strong></a> to help enforce our regulations. Dyno has an advertisement and spam detection. Bypassing, or attempting to bypass will warrant a strike.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_5:_Misusage_of_Bots." class="mw-headline">Rule 4: Misusage of Bots.</span></h4>
<p>Misusing any of our bots in a way that is disruptive to staff or others is not allowed. We ask that all commands go into #bot-commands, and we ask that you don't abuse the automated systems.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_6:_Arguments_and_Drama." class="mw-headline">Rule 5: Arguments and Drama.</span></h4>
<p>Arguing or starting drama with other members is not tolerated. We ask that you take up any issues you have with other users in Direct Messages, rather than in public chats.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_7:_Mass_Mentions_or_Staff_Mentions." class="mw-headline">Rule 6: Mass Mentions or Staff Mentions.</span></h4>
<p>Mentioning staff for no reason is an action punishable with a warn. Mass mentioning users is not allowed either. It annoys other users, and wastes their time.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_8:_Not_Safe_for_Work_Content." class="mw-headline">Rule 7: Not Safe for Work Content (NSFW).</span></h4>
<p>Not Safe for Work content is strictly prohibited here, and is punishable by ban. NSFW contains gore, pornography, racist or discriminative slurs, heavy profanity, and more.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_9:_Guidelines_and_Terms_of_Service." class="mw-headline">Rule 8: Guidelines and Terms of Service.</span></h4>
<p>We enforce all Discord Guidelines and Terms of Service in our server.</p>
<h4><span id="Regulation_10:_Common_Sense." class="mw-headline">Rule 9: Common Sense.</span></h4>
<p>As we only have 9 rules, we ask that you use common sense. If it's not allowed in other servers, it's most likely not allowed here either. Finding "loopholes" in our rules is not allowed either.</p>
